## Responsibilities
Deimantas Gedgaudas - database services (Firebase).
Aurelija Čygaitė, Marius Kriukovas, Jurgis Juknevičius - application itself. Aurelija was mainly responsible for Sign up/in screens and Profile tab, Marius - Routes tab, Jurgis - History tab and starting a route screens. However, we helped each other with issues, so we were heavy involved in other's responsibilities.
